My native language is Ukrainian and this is a single language on app. But all interface text was made with I18n and easy to change with translating locale file.

Uncle Scrooge is the main character of one of the Disney studio's favorite childhood cartoons, "DuckTales". In the opening animation of the cartoon, there is a moment when the uncle is bathing in his big stash of coins and is incredibly happy about them. I can confidently say that coins evoke similar emotions in numismatists because I am a numismatist.

The functionality will be described later - work on the project is still ongoing.
